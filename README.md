# Overview

The software I wrote is a simple TicTacToe game that uses classes to create some sort of encapsulation within the program. The program handles many conditions such as if the board is a tie, or has either winner X or winner O and it also handles if the user does not input a valid input so it is recursive.

I wrote the software because it was something that I believe would help me to gain a good understanding of the c++ coding language but also would not be to overwhelming for a beginner project in this language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code to create this c++ project but I had also experiments with Clion and visual studio but I was most comfortable using the Visual Studio Code IDE since I have been using it for a much longer time though Clion seemed to be very helpful for learning.

I did not use any libraries but I wanted to used the conio.h header but this library is inaccesible on mac so I was not able to but it would have been very nice for checking key press inputs.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

-I would like to add the conio library and check for key press because the game would be much smoother.
-Create a bigger tictactoe board which would make win condition algorithms a little more tricky
- I would like make it so that the user can use numbers 1-3 for the rows and columns instead of 0-2 because this way is a little confusing.
